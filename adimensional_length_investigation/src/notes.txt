Hi,

If you're still interested, this is the sheet containing my initial thoughts of the MPhys projects.

I've tried to score them between 0-5 and also colour code them.

The ones I haven't rated didn't really catch my eye, but if you one has caught your eye I'll have a closer look.

The ones I have scored (relatively high) tend to be theory based solid state ones with a few medical and particle ones as well.

If you want to have a chat, I'll be in Schuster over the next few days.
